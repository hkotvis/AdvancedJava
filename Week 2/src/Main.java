//1.Create a “Person” class with 3 instance properties: firstName(a String), lastName(a String) and age (an int).
// In addition to a default constructor, how may additional, overloaded constructors can you think of to create? Create them.
//
// 2.Class properties (declared static) are shared by all object instances created from that class. Can you think of a Person property
// that should be shared? Add that to your Person class. Then write a method that retrieves that data. How should this method be written?
//
// 3.From a separate “Startup” class, create several Person objects and store them in an array. Now write a for-loop to iterate over that
// array and output the full name and age of each of the Person objects stored in that array.
